# CHANGELOG

## ENTRY 4: The Great Simplification - When Less Becomes More

Embraced the philosophical art of subtraction by refining Python environment detection to show only what truly matters - active environments rather than dormant archaeological artifacts. Removed the complexity of scanning for inactive .venv, venv, Poetry, Pipenv, and Conda environments lurking in directories, choosing instead to focus exclusively on the $VIRTUAL_ENV environment variable that indicates actual usage.

### Minimalist Improvements Made:
- **Detection Simplification**: Streamlined Python environment detection to only check $VIRTUAL_ENV
- **Version Increment**: Bumped project version from 0.1.3 to 0.1.4 across all configuration files
- **Documentation Alignment**: Updated README to accurately reflect the new focused detection approach
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary detection functions for inactive environments
- **User Experience Enhancement**: Status line now respects user attention by showing only relevant active context

This change follows the wisdom of Diogenes - cutting away the unnecessary to reveal what is essential. Why burden users with information about environments that exist but aren't being used? The result is a status line that speaks only when it has something meaningful to say, making the active Python environment indicator a signal of genuine intent rather than mere presence.

## ENTRY 3: Documentation Renaissance - When Words Finally Match Reality

Orchestrated a comprehensive documentation synchronization session, bringing the README into perfect alignment with our evolved codebase. Updated version references from the antiquated 0.1.1 to our current 0.1.3, ensuring users aren't left wandering in version purgatory. Thoroughly documented the sophisticated Python environment detection capabilities with their elegant hierarchy of discovery, and provided crystal-clear guidance on the `--display-model` CLI option.

### Documentation Enhancements Made:
- **Version Accuracy**: Updated all references from 0.1.1 to 0.1.3 across installation examples
- **Feature Documentation**: Comprehensive coverage of Python environment detection capabilities 
- **CLI Options Guide**: Detailed explanation of `--display-model` flag with practical examples
- **Configuration Examples**: Multiple real-world configuration scenarios for different use cases
- **Troubleshooting Expansion**: Enhanced problem-solving guidance for Python environment detection
- **Visual Examples**: Clear output examples showing different status line configurations

This documentation renaissance ensures that new users can immediately understand and leverage all the status line's capabilities, while existing users can discover features they might have missed. The gap between implementation and explanation has been bridged with the precision of a master craftsman.

## ENTRY 2: Status Line Gets Smarter - User-Controlled Model Display Revolution

Enhanced the claude-status-line with a game-changing new feature: configurable model display! Users can now choose whether they want to see the AI model name in their status line using the new `--display-model` (or `-m`) command-line flag. This provides much-needed customization control over the displayed information, allowing developers to tailor their status line to their preferences.

### Key Improvements Made:
- **New CLI Option**: Added `--display-model` flag for optional model name display
- **Function Enhancement**: Extended `buildStatusLine` with `displayModel` boolean parameter
- **Conditional Rendering**: Implemented smart logic to show/hide model component based on user preference
- **Python Display Cleanup**: Simplified Python environment display to show only the environment name for cleaner output
- **Code Quality**: Applied consistent formatting throughout with improved indentation and structure

This update transforms the status line from a fixed display into a customizable tool that adapts to individual developer workflows. Whether you're working with multiple models and need that visibility, or prefer a cleaner interface without model information, the choice is now yours.
