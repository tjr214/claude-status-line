## **1. Context**

Remember what project we are working on, its tech stack, and the goals of the project.

Read and fully analyze the referenced Comprehensive Plan for success, below. Thoroughly understand it from the perspective of a senior engineer.

Here is the Comprehensive Plan, in its current state (this may be a big file so read it completely and fully):

```
@dev-journal/OUR-PLAN.md
```

## **2. Instructions**

Perform a senior engineer's analysis of the Plan:

- Give me a detailed analysis of the Plan. Layout its strengths and weaknesses.

- Does it have all the necessary information required to accomplish the goals? Is it missing anything that SHOULD be in there?

- Any noticeable security and/or performance concerns?

- Perform a prioritization assessment. If needed, we can re-order the tasks in the Plan.

- Perform a dependency analysis. Once again, if needed, we can re-order the tasks in the Plan.

- Make sure the priorities and dependencies make sense and do not contradict or conflict with each other.

- Anything else you think I should know: use your knowledge to the fullest extent.

Let me know all of your thoughts on these very critical and important matters.

Do you have any questions for me about the Plan and our work? Anything I should clarify for you?
