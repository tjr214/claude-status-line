description: "Expand the tasks in OUR-PLAN into detailed sub-tasks."

## **1. Context**

Remember what project we are working on, its tech stack, and the goals of the project.

Read and fully analyze the attached Comprehensive Plan for success, below. Thoroughly understand it from the perspective of a senior engineer.

Here is the Comprehensive Plan (`dev-journal/OUR-PLAN.md`), in its current state (this may be a big file so read it completely and fully):

```
@dev-journal/OUR-PLAN.md
```

## **2. Instructions**

Analyze our Comprehensive Plan and find any tasks that are too broad or vague or would just generally benefit from being expanded into sub-tasks.

**IMPORTANT:** Then, expand those tasks into detailed sub-tasks. These sub-tasks should contain everything needed for their integration into the plan: instructions, any files that need to be read or studied, any applicable pseudocode or code, relevant notes, etc.

When done, review the Plan, again, and ensure our changes 1) make sense in the full context of the project, and 2) enhance the understandability of the Plan so our junior engineers can follow it without any confusion.

**CRITICAL:** Finally, check back in with me to get approval before updating the Plan with the new sub-tasks.

Do you have any questions for me about the Plan and our work? Anything I should clarify for you?

## **3. Task Checklist (Use your `TodoWrite` tool)**

- [ ] Read and understand the referenced Comprehensive Plan from the perspective of a senior engineer.
- [ ] If I have any questions or need the user to clarify something, ask. If not, proceed to the next step.
- [ ] Analyze the Plan and find any tasks that are too broad or vague or would just generally benefit from being expanded into sub-tasks.
- [ ] Expand those tasks into detailed sub-tasks.
  - [ ] Make sure everything that is needed for the sub-task is included. Remember, the OUR-PLAN.md file is a living document and will be updated with the new sub-tasks and must contain everything needed for a junior engineer to follow the plan and complete the sub-tasks and, eventually, the entire task.
- [ ] Review the Plan, again, and ensure our changes:
  - [ ] 1. make sense in the full context of the project, and
  - [ ] 2. enhance the understandability of the Plan so our junior engineers can follow it without any confusion.
- [ ] Check back in with the user to get approval before updating the Plan (located at `dev-journal/OUR-PLAN.md`) with the new sub-tasks and information.
