## **1. Context**

Remember what project we are working on, its tech stack, and the goals of the project.

Read and fully analyze the referenced Comprehensive Plan for success, below. Thoroughly understand it from the perspective of a senior engineer.

Here is the Comprehensive Plan, in its current state (this may be a big file so read it completely and fully):

```
@dev-journal/OUR-PLAN.md
```

## **2. High-Level Overview**

- _Project Description:_

```
@dev-journal/PROJECT-DESCRIPTION.md
```

- _Tech Stack:_

```
@dev-journal/TECH-STACK.md
```

Our Comprehensive Plan is a living document that grows and evolves as we work on the project. It is a living record of our work and our progress. The Plan may also contain code, pseudocode, and other information we will need to successfully complete our tasks.

## **3. Instructions**

Read and fully understand our Plan from a senior engineering perspective.

The Plan should already have a priority and dependency structure built into it. If you discover that this is not the case, suggest to me that I run the `/plan:analyze-our-plan` command.

If you feel the Plan is too vague or unclear, suggest to me that I run the `/plan:expand-our-plan` command.

Summarize our Key Priorities and Goals.

Do you have any questions for me about the Plan and our work? Anything I should clarify for you? Ask all of the questions you need to.

Let me know when you fully understand Our Plan and we are on the same page.
