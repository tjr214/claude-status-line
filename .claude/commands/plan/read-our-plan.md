## **WORK SESSION BOOTUP**

### **1. Context Gathering**

Remember what project we are working on, its tech stack, and the goals of the project.

#### **Project Overview**

- **Project Description:**

```
@dev-journal/PROJECT-DESCRIPTION.md
```

- **Tech Stack:**

```
@dev-journal/TECH-STACK.md
```

- **Product Requirements:**

```
@dev-journal/PRD-MINI.md
```

#### **Current Plan Analysis**

Read and fully analyze the referenced Comprehensive Plan for success, below. Thoroughly understand it from the perspective of a senior engineer.

Here is the Comprehensive Plan, in its current state (this may be a big file so read it completely and fully):

```
@dev-journal/OUR-PLAN.md
```

### **2. Plan Understanding & Analysis**

Our Comprehensive Plan is a living document that grows and evolves as we work on the project. It is a living record of our work and our progress. The Plan may also contain code, pseudocode, and other information we will need to successfully complete our tasks.

#### **Analysis Tasks**

Using your TodoWrite tool, track the following analysis:

- [ ] Read and understand the complete Comprehensive Plan from a senior engineering perspective
- [ ] Identify the plan's structure and organization
- [ ] Understand the priority and dependency relationships
- [ ] Assess plan completeness and clarity
- [ ] Identify any gaps or areas needing attention

#### **Plan Validation**

The Plan should already have a priority and dependency structure built into it. If you discover that this is not the case, suggest to me that I run the `/plan/analyze-our-plan` command.

If you feel the Plan is too vague or unclear, suggest to me that I run the `/plan/expand-our-plan` command.

### **3. Summary & Recommendations**

After analyzing the plan, provide:

#### **Key Priorities and Goals Summary**

- List the main objectives
- Highlight critical milestones
- Identify immediate next steps

#### **Plan Health Assessment**

- **Structure Quality:** Is the plan well-organized with clear phases?
- **Task Clarity:** Are individual tasks specific and actionable?
- **Dependencies:** Are task dependencies clearly mapped?
- **Completeness:** Does the plan address all requirements?

#### **Recommendations**

Based on your analysis, recommend:

- Any commands that should be run to improve the plan
- Areas that need clarification or expansion
- Potential risks or concerns identified

### **4. Readiness Confirmation**

Do you have any questions for me about the Plan and our work? Anything I should clarify for you? Ask all of the questions you need to.

Let me know when you fully understand Our Plan and we are on the same page.

### **5. Next Steps**

After confirming understanding, suggest appropriate next actions:

- If ready to work: Recommend using `/plan/resume-work-from-plan`
- If plan needs improvement: Recommend specific plan commands
- If questions remain: List what needs clarification

**Remember:** The goal is complete alignment on the plan before proceeding with implementation work.
