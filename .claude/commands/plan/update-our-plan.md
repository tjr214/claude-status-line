description: "Update OUR-PLAN with suggestions (usually from another AI)."
thinking: true

## **1. Context**

Remember what project we are working on, its tech stack, and the goals of the project.

Read and fully analyze the referenced Comprehensive Plan for success, below. Thoroughly understand it from the perspective of a senior engineer.

Here is the Comprehensive Plan, in its current state (this may be a big file so read it completely and fully):

```
@dev-journal/OUR-PLAN.md
```

## **2. Instructions**

After you read and fully understand the Comprehensive Plan, the tasks it contains, and our project as a whole, we then need to update the Plan. First, confirm you understand the current plan structure and are ready to receive the update instructions.

**IMPORTANT:** The update instructions will contain everything you need to know to successfully update the Plan (how to replace things, add things, modify things, adding tasks, deleting tasks, etc. The whole nine yards).

Ensure the updated Plan maintains proper structure and formatting with the rest of the Plan.

If there is anything I should clarify for you, let me know NOW.

When you're ready to make changes (after I provide the update instructions):

1. Create a backup of the current Plan (copy to `dev-journal/OUR-PLAN.backup.md`).
2. Apply the updates.
3. Present a summary of what changed.

Before proceeding, verify:

- [ ] Update instructions are clear and actionable.
- [ ] Backup location is writable.

If you are ready to make changes, let me know.
