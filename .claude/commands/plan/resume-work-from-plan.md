## **WORK SESSION BOOTUP**

- Remember what project we are working on, its tech stack, and the goals of the project.

- Read and fully analyze the referenced Comprehensive Plan for success, below. Thoroughly understand it from the perspective of a senior engineer.

## **1. Context**

Here is the Comprehensive Plan, in its current state (this may be a big file so read it completely and fully):

```
@dev-journal/OUR-PLAN.md
```

The Plan contains a checklist of tasks that need to be completed and, thus, also serves as a record of what has already been accomplished. If at any time you need to see more details of the work we have already done, refer to the `dev-journal/CHANGELOG.md` file.

The Plan may also contain code, pseudocode, and other information we will need to successfully complete our tasks.

## **2. Instructions**

Let's continue our work from where we left off. Ensure you update the checklists in the Plan as we go.

**CRITICAL:** ALWAYS sync your internal TODO system (`TodoWrite`) with the Plan. This makes sure the whole team stays on the same page:

1. Read the current Comprehensive Plan checklist items.
2. **Always** verify and understand the files, classes, etc. from our codebase that are referenced in the Plan, when you get to the section of the Plan we are working on.
3. Create corresponding TODOs for unchecked items in the section we are currently working on.
4. **IMPORTANT:** Do the Work, making appropriate use of available expert planning Agents (tell the Agents to read the `dev-journal/OUR-PLAN.md` file from the **specific section we are working on**. Provide it with line numbers or ranges for it to read).
5. Mark completed TODOs for checked items.
6. REMEMBER: Update the `dev-journal/OUR-PLAN.md` file directly when tasks are completed (check boxes, add notes).
7. If we complete a whole section of the Plan, then we should perform an agentic git commit with the `git-commit-philosopher` agent.

When you are done, report back to confirm you have followed the Plan. Provide a brief status update, including:

- [ ] Tasks completed this session.
- [ ] Current blockers or questions.
- [ ] Results of the git-commit-philosopher agent, if applicable.
- [ ] Tell me the next upcoming items on the Plan.

**IMPORTANT:** Do you have any questions for me before we begin our work? Anything I should clarify for you?
