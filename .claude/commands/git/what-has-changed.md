# What Has Changed Since Last Commit

Use the `git-diff-analyzer` expert to analyze all changes in the repository since the last commit and provide us with a comprehensive technical report. Take on the role of an expert technical writer and provide us with a comprehensive report with paragraphs interspersed with many bullet points. If very little has changed you do not need to bullshit to make the report any longer and "comprehensive" than it needs to be.
