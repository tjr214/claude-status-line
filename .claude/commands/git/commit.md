description: "Do our git commit process"
---

Use the `git-commit-philosopher` agent to do our git commit process, following the `git` Workflow Ruleset. Report in when done, making sure each of the steps in the `git` Workflow Ruleset have been followed by the agent and that there are no conflicts or issues we need to address, together.
