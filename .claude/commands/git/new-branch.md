If we are on a branch or on `main` and there are untracked files and/or uncommitted changes, do our git commit process FIRST. Follow the `git` Workflow Ruleset.

If we are ready to create the new feature branch, do the following:

1. Create a new feature branch named `$ARGUMENTS`.
2. Switch to the new feature branch and sync with github.
3. Report in when done, making sure you have followed each of the steps above.
