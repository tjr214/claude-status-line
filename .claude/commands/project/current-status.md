# Project Status & Progress Overview

## **1. Recent Work Analysis**

### **CHANGELOG Review (Recent Activity)**

Read and analyze the first 200 lines of our CHANGELOG to understand recent work completed: `dev-journal/CHANGELOG.md`

**Analysis Focus:**

- What major features or changes were recently completed?
- Any critical technical decisions or architectural changes?
- Notable achievements or milestones reached?
- Any patterns in our recent development work?

## **2. Current Plan Assessment**

### **Comprehensive Plan Review**

Read and analyze our current plan to understand where we are and where we're going: `dev-journal/OUR-PLAN.md`

**Analysis Focus:**

- What is our current position in the overall plan?
- Which tasks or phases have been completed vs. remaining?
- Any blocked or stalled items that need attention?
- Critical dependencies or prerequisites for next steps?

## **3. Synthesis & Status Report**

Using the TodoWrite tool, organize your findings into these key areas:

### **Recent Accomplishments Summary**

- List 3-5 key achievements from recent work
- Highlight any major technical breakthroughs or decisions
- Note any challenges overcome or lessons learned
- **IMPORTANT:** If timestamps are present, cite them.

### **Current Project Health**

- Overall project status (on track, ahead, behind, blocked?)
- Any technical debt or maintenance issues identified?
- Code quality and testing status
- Documentation completeness

### **Where We Left Off**

- What was the last major task completed?
- Any work-in-progress that needs attention?
- Outstanding issues or bugs that need resolution?

### **Next Priority Options**

Based on the plan analysis, identify 3-5 logical next steps:

- High-priority items that should be tackled immediately
- Medium-priority tasks that could be good alternatives
- Any prerequisite work needed before major features
- Opportunities for quick wins or momentum builders

## **4. Recommendations & Questions**

### **Strategic Recommendations**

- Should we run any plan analysis commands (`/plan:analyze-our-plan`, `/plan:expand-our-plan`)?
- Are there any new features to implement or bugs to be squashed that require use of the `/gemini:get-plan-for-new-feature` command (which by-passes the `OUR-PLAN.md` file)?
- Are there areas where the plan needs updating or clarification?
- Any technical decisions or architecture discussions needed?

### **Tactical Next Steps**

- What specific command should we run next to continue progress?
- Any immediate blockers or dependencies to resolve?
- Suggested work session focus based on current state?

## **5. Team Alignment Check**

Do you have any questions about our current status, recent work, or upcoming priorities? Anything about the project direction that needs clarification or discussion?

Let me know if you want to dive deeper into any specific area or if you're ready to proceed with the next phase of work.
