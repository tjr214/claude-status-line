Enacted the second wave of philosophical minimalism by dramatically simplifying the Python environment detection system, removing the archaeological approach of scanning for dormant environments in favor of trusting the user's explicit intentions. Deleted four complex detection functions (checkVenvDirectory, checkPoetry, checkPipenv, checkConda) that were essentially performing digital spelunking through filesystem artifacts, replacing this entire bureaucracy with a single elegant check of the VIRTUAL_ENV environment variable. This represents a profound shift from "what could be detected" to "what is actually active" - honoring the user's deliberate choice to activate an environment rather than presuming to know better through directory inspection.

The getPythonEnvInfo function now embodies the zen principle of doing one thing well: it simply asks the system "what Python environment are you actively using?" rather than conducting an exhaustive inventory of every possible environment that might exist. This change eliminates the potential confusion of showing inactive environments and respects the user's workflow by only displaying information about environments they've explicitly chosen to work with. Like Diogenes casting away unnecessary possessions, we've stripped away the complexity that served detection completeness rather than user clarity.

The result is a more reliable, faster, and philosophically honest Python environment indicator that speaks only when the user has made a conscious decision to work within a virtual environment, making the status line a reflection of deliberate action rather than coincidental filesystem arrangements.
