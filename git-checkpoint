Enhanced claude-status-line with configurable model display option. Added a new command-line flag `--display-model` (or `-m`) that allows users to optionally show the AI model name in their status line, providing greater customization control over the displayed information. The implementation includes a new boolean parameter in the main function, conditional rendering logic for the model component, and proper CLI option integration with Cliffy Command. Additionally, simplified the Python environment display to show only the environment name for cleaner output, and applied consistent code formatting throughout the module with improved indentation and structure.
