Elevated the status line from merely showing directory names to intelligently displaying git remote repository information, transforming the humble folder emoji into a sophisticated link emoji that reveals the true identity of projects. Implemented comprehensive git remote URL parsing that gracefully handles HTTPS, SSH, and Git protocol formats, extracting the essential username/repository-name combination that developers actually care about. Added the --display-project-name CLI flag to give users control over project name visibility, because sometimes the path to wisdom is knowing when NOT to show information. Updated the display hierarchy to prioritize remote repository information over local directory names, following the philosophical principle that context matters more than location. Incremented version from 0.1.4 to 0.1.5 and updated all documentation to reflect these architectural improvements. The result is a status line that now speaks the language of modern distributed development - showing ðŸ”— username/repo-name when connected to the greater codebase ecosystem, gracefully falling back to ðŸ“‚ directory-name when working in isolation. This change embodies the wisdom that true identity comes not from where you are, but from where you belong in the larger tapestry of collaborative creation.
