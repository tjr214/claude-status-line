Refined Python environment detection to embrace the philosophical principle of minimalism - only displaying what is actively in use rather than cluttering the interface with dormant possibilities. Simplified the detection logic to exclusively check for active virtual environments via the $VIRTUAL_ENV environment variable, removing the complexity of scanning for inactive .venv, venv, Poetry, Pipenv, and Conda environments in directories. Simultaneously incremented the project version from 0.1.3 to 0.1.4 across all configuration files and updated the README documentation to accurately reflect this more focused approach. This change embodies the wisdom of showing users only what matters in their current context - an activated Python environment - rather than overwhelming them with the archaeological remnants of environments that exist but remain unused. The result is a cleaner, more purposeful status line that respects the user's attention and provides information only when it's genuinely relevant to their active development session.
