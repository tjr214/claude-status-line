This document defines everything you need to know about the project we are currently working on. Adhere to these rules at all times.

## **1. Establish Project Context (Always Refer To This)**

This is a project ruleset for our latest creation. The user will provide project-specific details in the sections below. Your first priority is to read and internalize the user-provided information.

- **1.1. Project Description:** Locate the user's project description below. This defines the project's purpose.
  ```
  @dev-journal/PROJECT-DESCRIPTION.md
  ```
- **1.2. Technology Stack:** Locate the user's technology stack information below. This defines the tools, languages, and frameworks for the project.
  ```

  ```

## **2. The Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

This is the document that defines the product requirements for the project. Always refer to this document and keep it in mind when making decisions and writing code.

If the PRD is not provided, just let the user know that you don't have one and ask them to provide one. They may need to use task-master to create one.

- **2.1. PRD Data:** Locate the project's PRD below. This defines the product requirements for the project.
